# RL Algorithms

Implementations of some common RL algorithms. Currently a work-in-progress.

Plans to add tabular algorithms from Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction 2nd
Ed. by Sutton and Barto chapters 5, 6, and 8.

Also would like to look at making basic implementations of AlphaZero and MuZero.
These (particularly AlphaZero) may require a different environment interface
than the one Gym provides.
